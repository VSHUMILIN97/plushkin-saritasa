# plushkin-saritasa
### Rationale
#### Ever encountered this situation once in your life?

>Itâ€™s a common problem - having some file duplications in your system. Some of us can collect a lot of stuff like images or PDF-books and so on. And sometimes there are several copies of the same file only with the name difference 

#### This is not a problem anymore

We are glad to introduce you a tool which can help you to clean your folders and remove all the duplicates.
Don't worry, this is not that type of an app, that will erase everything from your computer and don't even peep about it.
We will **gently ask you** whether do you want to delete all this *SECRETIMAGEOFNUDEKATEFROMPARTY.img.dontopen.if.you.are.my.wife* copies stored in different folders (~~for safety reasons of course~~) or not. 
Just provide **plushkin.py** with a directory path to start searching with and you'll know if there are any garbage duplicates saved for the rainy day or everything is fresh and clean

### How do I use it?

It is very simple. Like a piece of cake or a sip of vanilla soda

```python3 plushkin.py /path/to/my/folder```

#### or you can do this (in case you in the directory you want to start analyse)
```python3 plushkin.py .```

#### See? That's very simple
However, if you feel confident about Kate's photoes (_she is not your type of girls anyways_), try to do **this**

```python3 plushkin.py -d /path/to/folder```

This will start an interactive command line user interface, which will help you to keep Kate's photoes were they stored and delete everything else. May be something unuseful, like a calendar with your relatives birthdays (~~Who even cares about uncle Alfredo and aunt Sara?~~)
#### HOW IT WORKS (~~eyes hurting gif~~)
